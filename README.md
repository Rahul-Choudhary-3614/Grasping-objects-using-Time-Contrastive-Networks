# Grasping-objects-using-Time-Contrastive-Networks
 In this I have used Time-Contrastive Networks and soft-Actor critic Algorithm to make robot grasp different objects 

TCN.py => Script used to Train Time-Contrastive Network

SAC.py => Script used to Train robot learn grasping using Soft-Actor critic Algorithm

robot_2.py,rx.py => Modified Kuka Robot for this project
